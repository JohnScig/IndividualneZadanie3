# Transformer Bank
ATM and Bank System application for local bank.


## Projects in solution
**ATM**

Application simulating ATM. For now it is just an empty form.

**BankSystem**

THE ONE AND ONLY system for the bank. Already contains all the needed forms, with descriptions and connections between them.

**Data**

Library for accessing database. Do not forget to use repository/model (a.k.a. * *repository pattern* *).

**Support**

Two awesome classes:
- **NumericTextBox**: Allows only numeric input, so you do not have to check it after it. You can also set whether you want to support decimal numbers or/and negative values.
- **Generator**: Class for generating random data, so you do not have to type it manually. Awesome.
